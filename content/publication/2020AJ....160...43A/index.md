### Abstract

The stellar velocity distribution function (DF) in the solar vicinity is re-examined using data from the SDSS APOGEE survey's DR16 and *Gaia* DR2. By exploiting APOGEE's ability to chemically discriminate with great reliability the thin disk, thick disk and (accreted) halo populations, we can, for the first time, derive the three-dimensional velocity DFs for these chemically-separated populations. We employ this smaller, but more data-rich APOGEE+*Gaia* sample to build a *data-driven model* of the local stellar population velocity DFs, and use these as basis vectors for assessing the relative density proportions of these populations over 5 < R < 12 kpc, and -1.5 < z < 2.5 kpc range as derived from the larger, more complete (i.e., all-sky, magnitude-limited) *Gaia* database. We find that $81.9 \pm 3.1$% of the objects in the selected *Gaia* data-set are thin-disk stars, $16.6 \pm 3.2$% are thick-disk stars, and $1.5 \pm 0.1$% belong to the Milky Way stellar halo. We also find the local thick-to-thin-disk density normalization to be $\rho_{T}(R_{\odot})/\rho_{t}(R_{\odot}) = 2.1 \pm 0.2$%, a result consistent with, but determined in a completely different way than, typical starcount/density analyses. Using the same methodology, the local halo-to-disk density normalization is found to be $\rho_{H}(R_{\odot})/(\rho_{T}(R_{\odot}) + \rho_{t}(R_{\odot})) = 1.2 \pm 0.6$%, a value that may be inflated due to chemical overlap of halo and metal-weak thick disk stars.
